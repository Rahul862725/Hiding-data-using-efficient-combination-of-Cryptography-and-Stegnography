# Hiding-data-using-efficient-combination-of-Cryptography-and-Stegnography
This Research paper implementation describe the efficient way to transmit the information.
This project has three components.

1. Encryption Decryption of text using Asymmetric key Cryptography Algorithm ( RSA )
2. Compression Decompression Encrypted text using Huffman coding
3. Hide and retrieve Compress data into image using LSB Steganography
